# Events Manager API

This is a very simple events manger API created using NodeJs and Mongoose as an assignment for the Reskill Americans Bootcamp.

This API uses the REST API convention with full CRUD operations and has very basic search capabilites. You can create events, query for all existing events, query for a single event by ID, update an event by ID and delete an event by ID. The database is Mongo DB using mongoose. There are some basic validations present in the eventsSchema.
